# Arduino-
This repository presents  the design of Arduino Board .The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, we need to use external  Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs . The below figure shows the power module of arduino board using eagle tool.

This Power Module Consist of Voltage Regulator, Power_jackpth_lock, 2-Capacitors and vcc.with Input voltage 7V to 16V .


VOLTAGE REGULATOR:
A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage. A voltage regulator may use a simple feed-forward design or may include negative feedback. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.
Electronic voltage regulators are found in devices such as computer power supplies where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and other elements. In automobile alternators and central power station generator plants, voltage regulators control the output of the plant. In an electric power distribution system, voltage regulators may be installed at a substation or along distribution lines so that all customers receive steady voltage independent of how much power is drawn from the line.


POWER_JACKPTH_LOCK:
Power circuit wired up
Whenever a net splits in two directions a junction node is created. This signifies that all three intersecting nets are connected. If two nets cross, but there's not a junction, those nets are not connected.


CAPACITORS;
A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals.
The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance. While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit, a capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit. The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or condensator.This name and its cognates are still widely used in many languages, but rarely in English, one notable exception being condenser microphones, also called capacitor microphones.

ATmega328P is a high performance yet low power consumption 8-bit AVR microcontroller thatâ€™s able to achieve the most single clock cycle execution of 131 powerful instructions thanks to its advanced RISC architecture. It can commonly be found as a processor in Arduino boards such as Arduino Fio and Arduino Uno.

Product Applications
The ATmega328P is supported with a full suite of program and system development tools which includes: C compilers, macro assemblers, program debugger/simulators, in-circuit emulators, and evaluation kits.

The fast PWM mode that provides a high-frequency PWM waveform generation allows for it to be suited for power regulation, rectification, and DAC applications.

We have also used Header Pins as shown below

The Arduino project began in 2005 as a tool for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats and motion detectors.
